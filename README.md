# Scooter program

This repository is part of a group project in program development in virtual team course (vteam) at [Blekinge Institute of Technology](https://www.bth.se/). The group project consists of several parts, and this is one of them, which we call **The intelligence of the scooter**. 

**The program is under development.**


## Start

Run **python3 main.py** to start a ***User mode***, which means a menu of options will appear for the user to choose what to do, the program will ask the user to enter the scooter id, if the scooter is available then a menu of options will appear, and the rental time will begin.

### Run with Docker

```
```


## Simulation

Run **python3 simulation.py** to start a ***Simulation mode***, which means 1000 customers and 1000 scooters will be simulated.

### Run with Docker

```
```
